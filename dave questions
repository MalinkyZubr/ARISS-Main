LunaNet: Flexible extensible Lunar Navigation Infrastructure

what are the limitations that IP protocol has in lunanet? are you referring to ip saturation
the paper mentions that DTN bunders are similar to datagrams. What makes streams a poor option in space?

Will the lunar gateway be the first part of this lunar network? The high earth orbit relay station?

With a separate RF band allocated to each overarching communication routes (moon to earth vs earth to moon, for instance) how well do you see the lunanet model scaling when it extends to other planets, or asteroids in the distant future?

in the case of PNT, how do you see it adapting to communication with mars, with the delay being several minutes for a radio signal to reach mars from earth?

Are these resources that NASA intends to share internationally? if not do we anticipate there being parallel systems in place eventually from countries like china depending on separate protocols?

In future, how will existing satellite infrastructure like the TDRS constellation be integrated with the deep space network?

ask general questions about DSP, networking
